 Massage and rubbing bodies against each other presents no risk of passing on HIV.

HIV is not able to be transmitted through intact skin. 

Massage is a fun, safe and therapeutic way to relax. Occasionally a massage have erotic elements so such as [masturbation]({{< ref "masturbation.md" >}}) or [oral sex]({{< ref "oral-sex.md" >}}) of which are also considered safe from HIV risk.

If you have any cuts, sores or open wounds it is best to avoid massage or contact with bodily fluids.
