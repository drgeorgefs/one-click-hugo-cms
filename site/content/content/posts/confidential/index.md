Australian guidelines express the importance of confidential HIV testing to be available for all people who wish or need to be tested.

Medical records are encrypted and confidential.

Your medical records are private and only you and your doctor will be able to see you have had a rapid test.

If you are worried about using your name you do have to option to use a different name to enable you to get an anonymous test.

Because the rapid HIV test is a private test it will not show up in your Medicare record, the appointment will only show as a standard GP appointment.

If you would prefer no Medicare record the appointment can be done privately.

The most important part is to get the test and know your status.

To book an appointment simply call: [1800 138 156](tel:+611800138156) and request an appointment with Dr George Forgan-Smith for a rapid test.
