Booking an appointment for a rapid HIV test is straight forward.

* Call Collins Street Medical Centre on [1800 138 156](tel:+611800138156)
* Request a rapid test appointment with Dr George Forgan-Smith
* Please understand that the ***front desk staff are not doctors***, they are not able to answer questions about the test.
* When you arrive you can expect the process to take around 30 minutes as the test takes 20 minutes to develop.
* During your appointment you will be able to relax or grab a coffee while waiting for the test to develop.

My office is easily found on Collins Street in the middle of Melbourne's CBD.
