You do not require a Medicare card to be able to book a rapid HIV test.

If you prefer the appointment can be done as a private appointment however you would not be able to claim the Medicare benefit.

If you are from overseas, a visitor or not medical eligible you will still be able to get tested at Collins Street Medical.

To book an appointment simply call: [1800 138 156](tel:+611800138156) and request an appointment with Dr George Forgan-Smith for a rapid test.
