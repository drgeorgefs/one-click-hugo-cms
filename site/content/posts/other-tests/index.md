HIV is only one of the sexually transmitted infections that is present in Melbourne.

For this reason when getting a screening I highly recommend considering the following tests as well:

* Chlamydia
* Gonorrhoea
* Syphilis
* Hepatitis A, B and C

This additional screening is available at Collins Street Medical Centre and can be as simple as a swab, urine test or blood test.

These tests are not available as rapid tests, however Dorevitch Pathology is very swift and we are able to SMS results as soon as they are available, usually the next day.

To book an appointment simply call: [1800 138 156](tel:+611800138156) and request an appointment with Dr George Forgan-Smith for a rapid test.
